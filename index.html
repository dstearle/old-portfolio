                        For the past couple years I have been taking classes through Palomar College to see what the world of web development and tech was like.
                        I first started with a certificate program for web development and learned many of the basic skills needed to code such as basic html, css and javascript. When I had finished, I felt that this was definitely a career I could see myself thriving in so I decided to continue my education by completing an associates degree. From there I delved further into more advance classes and refined my skills in coding. Although I may have completed both a cerficate program and an associates, there is always more to learn!

                            <h4>What Did I Accomplish There?</h4>

                                <p>
                                    As an intern for RipeMetrics I was given many resouces and experienced guidance in how a developer operates in a working environment. On a day to day basis I worked in an linux environment for version control (git) using my own isolated branch to submit changes to the master repo for review. When I first started working at RipeMetrics we did not have a cloud9 so we had to setup our own work environments on our laptops. This was a learning experience for me in that I was able to learn how to do this complicated setup on my own for future purposes but also see what it takes to create a developer's environment from scratch. Eventually we did switch over to cloud9 and ever since I have been working in that environment. The API I worked on for RipeMetrics used Vue.js and Bootstrap for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. Being brought in as a full-stack intern I had the unique opportunity of being the first intern to ever work in the backend.
                                </p>
                
                                <p>
                                    One of the best parts of being in this internship was being able to meet other people working in the same workplace environment that I have become accustomed to. Doing most of my schooling online, I never really had the chance to meet other people who are also on the path of becoming a web developer. It was great being able to do paired programming and see how other people approach the same challenge with different eyes or even teach you new things you never knew. Luckily I also got to meet and work with interns following different but highly relevant career paths such as the people on our UI/UX team. Being in contact with them on a daily basis and seeing their perspectives on developing the same project we are working on have taught me the value of working in an agile environment. Considering how much I grew from the time I started, I can honestly say that I was very fortunate to be a part of RipeMetrics team!

                     <p>
                         Using responsive web design in my projects ensures that the sites I build are adaptable to any screen or window size the user wishes to use. In this example I retrofitted an existing site that did not originally use responsive web design by using several techniques.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                         In this scneario I added a meta viewport tag to determine the size of the user's interface and media queries to scale down or rearrange the content with several breakpoints. If you resize the window for the new project (labeled as Responsive) you can see how the content such as the navigation bar and images resize or rearrange to fit best into their containers where as the original (labeled as Non Responsive) will remain static and it's contents will be out of view when making the window smaller.
                     </p>

                         Although I am very comfortable building a website from scratch using tools such as HTML5 and CSS, I am also capable of using platforms such as WordPress. WordPress is a very popular tool used for building websites so I have made it a point to get familiar with it and its features.
                         As a side project I have made a blog that showcases my love for beer and my ability to maintain and update a site using WordPress. I do my best to showcase the different tools and advantages that WordPress offers to it's basic users.
