# old-portfolio

<strong>What is this project? :</strong>

- This was my first attempt at making a portfolio website before I had graduated from college. This was before I had learned any frameworks like Vue.js or Bootstrap so it is really primitive in that it only uses basic HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of Jquery. It is also incomplete because when I was in the process of building it I landed my first internship so I made a decision to set it aside for a while to focus on my internship so that when I was ready I could rebuild it with greater skill and new tools.
