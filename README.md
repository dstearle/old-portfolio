# old-portfolio
This was my first attempt at making a portfolio website before I graduated from college. This was before I had learned any frameworks like Vue.js or Bootstrap so it is really primitive in that it only uses basic HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of Jquery. It is also incomplete because when I was in the process of building it I landed my first internship and I made a decision to set aside for a while to focus on my internship so that when I was ready I could rebuild it with greater skill and using new tools.
